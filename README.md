My game is a Magnet role playing game where the player starts the game by choosing to play as a senior (easiest level), junior, sophomore, or freshman (hardest level). They then go through the game, making decisions about things like when they want to wake up, or whether or not they want to check PowerSchool and see their bad grades. Some of the player’s decisions will be affected by their stats, (the stats of the grade they chose in the beginning of the game). Based on their decisions/stats, the challenges throughout the game are easier or harder, and may affect their “win points”, the points needed to win the game. If the player can earn 10 win points or more by the end of the game, they win. If not, and they have more than 0 points, they can play an extra credit level to win.
